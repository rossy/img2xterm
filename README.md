img2xterm: display images on the terminal
=========================================

img2xterm is a program that can display bitmap images on 256-colour terminals
by converting them into Unicode block characters and xterm compatible control
sequences. Based on software by [lachs0r] [1] and Xebec for creating colourful
[cowfiles] [2], img2xterm improves on the colour selection and block printing
logic, providing cleaner output on terminals with nice bitmap fonts.

This is an example of a cowfile created with img2xterm's `--cow` option:

img2xterm uses a modified version of the algorithm used in [xterm256-conv] [3]
in order to have an accurate representation of the upper 240 colours used in
xterm. Modification was needed in order to fix the range of the grey ramp.

Dependencies
------------

Before compilation, make sure you have development versions of [ImageMagick]
[4] (for MagickWand), [Ncurses] [5] (for terminfo support), and [pkg-config] [6] (required to properly link MagickWand).

Getting img2xterm
-----------------

  The GNU Autotools are not required. To compile and install from source,
  simply run:

    $ make
    # make install

  A [GIMP] [6] palette containing the upper 240 colours used in xterm is also
  available. It can be used for dithering images before conversion. To install,
  run:

    $ cd extra/
    $ make
    $ cp xterm-256color.gpl ~/.gimp-2.6/palettes/

Converting images
-----------------

  To display an image on a compatible 256-color terminal:

    $ img2xterm image.png

  `img2cow` is a symlink to the `img2xterm` command. When invoked in this way,
  the program behaves as if the `--cow` option was used.

  To generate a cowfile:

    $ img2cow image.png image.cow
    # cp image.cow /usr/share/cows

Known issues
------------

* There is something wrong with the implementation of [CIE94 delta-E] [8].
* ImageMagick can be glitchy. Perhaps using libpng would be a better idea.
